<h1>Mark Gire's Code Quiz</h1>

<p> This application will allow the user to begin a 4 question coding assessment. When the user selects the 'Start' button, the timer will start at 30 seconds. The user will then go through 4 multiple choice questions, clicking the 'Answer' buttons to submit their answer. Incorrect questions will subtract 10 seconds from the timer. Once the user completes the assessment, the final screen will show the user how many questions were answered correctly and their 'Score' which is the timeleft when answering the final question. This score will be stored in the 'Last Score' section. The user can then select "Play Again" to return to the main screen and play again. </p>
